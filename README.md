# Medical Chatbot

This GitHub repository contains the code and files for a chatbot trained on a dataset of first aid and mental health information using TensorFlow and Keras. The chatbot can provide information and advice on a variety of medical and mental health topics, and can assist users in finding the help they need. The repository includes the code for training the model, as well as the chatbot file that can be used to run the chatbot.

Usage:  
1- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
2- Use the training.py file to train the model on the provided dataset. The training process may take some time depending on the size of your dataset and the resources available on your machine.  
3- Once the model has been trained, you can use the chatbot file to run the chatbot and start interacting with it.  
4- If you want to train the model on your own dataset, replace the data.json file with your custom dataset and then run the training.py file again.  
5- Once the model is trained on your custom dataset, you can use the chatbot file to run the chatbot and start interacting with it.
